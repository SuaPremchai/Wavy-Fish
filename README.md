This is NOT just a “Flappy X” clone!

How is this game different from all the others?
Quite simple: it offers a different kind of controls and optional modes, created by me, so you won’t find them elsewhere!

You can change the options before every game, so you will always get the challenge level that you prefer, according to your soul state, and/or the season.
Overtake your older results, and let everyone know it!
Try to pass all the 250 obstacles to win!
